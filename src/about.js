    intro: ['Hi, my name is Henry Valbuena and coding has been my hobby since the time I saw a computer when I was 12 years old, back then there were not many resources available for me where I could learn more about it, but that didn\'t stopped me. I was able to take a course about computers, then I read some books in the local library, but there was one thing missing, a PC where I could start experimenting. I got my first PC when I was in the university, things changed, I started creating simple programs in Java, then I was able to get an Internet service, things changed again, I started following a YouTube channel called thenewboston, from there I couldn\'t stop wanting to lear more and more. Many years later, after finding a job in Huawei, I found myself creating small programs and scripts that helped me and my coworkers autome rutine tasks in our daily duties. I thought, why am I not yet working as a programmer? Why I am not doing what I love for a living? After these kind of thoughts, 2017 hit me and made the decision, I will become a Professional Computer Programmer. I started refining my skills trying to align them with the industry and in 2018 took the step to quit my job and became a fulltime Computer Programmer at Seneca College. Now, here I am ready for the next challenge, wanting to learn even more now than ever, and always curious how things work.'],
