      "Hellow! Yes with a 'w'. My name is Henry and I'm an Electronic Computer Programmer... Wow that sounds fancy and complex, right? Ok, maybe not, but I like to call my self that way. I started my professional career as an Electronic Engineer, after eight years or so I decided that I will follow my passion and make my hobby part of that career, so I went for a Computer Programmer Diploma after and here I am ðŸŽ‰. And yes, you've guessed it! My hobby is programming. I've been doing it since I got my first computer, since then I haven't stopped ðŸ¤˜ yeah!",
